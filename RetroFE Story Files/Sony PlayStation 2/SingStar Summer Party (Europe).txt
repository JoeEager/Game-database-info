SingStar Summer Party is a karaoke game, featuring hit songs reminding summer and its hot nights.  The game gives points which are distributed by the purity of singing, as in how well does one manage to stay on tune. It doesn't matter if you change octaves in the middle of the song or what words are you singing in (it doesn't have a word recognition), so your singing is rated by how well you manage to hit the correct note at the correct time.  Here is the tracklist:  1. Adele - Chasing Pavements 2. Amy Winehouse - Tears Dry On Their Own 3. Blondie - The Tide is High 4. Blur - Girls
