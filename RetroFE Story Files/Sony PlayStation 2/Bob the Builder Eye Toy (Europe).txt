Bob the Builder has an exciting new challenge. The mayor himself has asked Bob to build the townâ€™s new sport centre. Itâ€™s a brilliant job, but thereâ€™s a small problem â€" Bobâ€™s only got one day to complete all the work. Wendy and all his friends are lending a hand (even lazybones Pilchard) but itâ€™s still too big a task. Bob needs your help â€" can you fix it? Yes, you can!  Easy to play for boys and girls from the age of three unsupervised and even younger when supervised by a parent.
