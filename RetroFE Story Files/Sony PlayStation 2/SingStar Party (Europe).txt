Following the way of the original SingStar game, this continuation boosts up the fun with even more songs. Sing solo or as a party, try out the battle mode or reach the high score in a duet. And if you're not in the mood to be judged, just go on for the freestyle mode and sing along the music video. And if you're not familiar with the lyrics, don't sweat it 'cos it's the pitch of your voice that's taken into consideration. You can buy this game with or without the two microphones, assuming you have the original SingStar game already.  30 more tracks that are added are:  1.  Alicia Keys - Fallin'  Ashford
