Guitar Hero Smash Hits is a spin-off Guitar Hero game featuring a compilation of songs from earlier releases in the franchise, including Guitar Hero, Guitar Hero II, Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s, Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock and Guitar Hero: Aerosmith.  The game's set list now supports four players in a full band set-up (introduced to the Guitar Hero series in  World Tour), an 8-player battle of the bands setup, and all songs are now original recordings from the genuine artists and are all playable in the Quick Play mode without the need to complete the career first.  Slight changes have also been made to the gameplay mechanics, including the addition of slider notes (again from World Tour) and the inclusion of the Expert+ difficulty setting for drums, which is carried over from Guitar Hero: Metallica.  Songs from Guitar Hero:  Blue Öyster Cult - "Godzilla" 2. Boston - "More Than A Feeling" 3. Deep Purple - "Smoke On The Water" 4. Franz Ferdinand - "Take Me Out" 5. Helmet - "Unsung (Live)" 6. Incubus - "Stellar" 7. Joan Jett
