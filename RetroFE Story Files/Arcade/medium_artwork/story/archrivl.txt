A hilarious basketball game featuring customizing team names and colours. A full game consists of 4 quarters, with 4 minutes each. Each team has 2 players, and the objective of the game is to outscore the opponent until the final buzzer sounds.
If the game results in a tie after 4 quarters, a sudden death overtime period is added, in which case the next basket to go in will win the game for the team who scored it. The overtime period is 1 minute long. A player can call for his teammate to pass him the ball or to shoot it.
There are 8 characters that the player can play as, each with a unique characteristic. They are :
* Blade : A crowd pleaser.
* Hammer : Rebound king.
* Lewis : Top shooter.
* Mohawk : Tough & mean.
* Moose : A real champ.
* Reggie : All-American.
* Tyrone : Defensive giant.
* Vinnie : A great player.
