A futuristically-themed racing game from Sega, in which the player takes on the role of the A.B. Cop; a law enforcement officer who rides a heavily armoured hover-bike and must chase down and destroy the perpetrators of an armed robbery before the time limit expires.
At the start of each level, the player's bike is equipped with a limited number of 'Jumps', which, when utilized, allows the bike to temporarily take to the air; useful in avoiding the many vehicles - both enemy and benign - that litter the tracks. Also, if a jump is timed correctly it's possible to drop onto and attack enemy targets from above. Blue Jump icons occasionally appear on the track and can be run over and collected.
In addition to the jumps, pushing UP on the joystick gives the bike a short speed boost; necessary if the levels are to be completed within the tight time limits the game imposes. Unlike the jumps, the bike has an unlimited number of speed boosts. At the end of each stage awaits a huge, end-of-level guardian - a first for the racing genre - each of which is heavily armed and takes multiple hits to destroy.
A.B. Cop is hugely reminiscent of Taito's superb racing legend, "Chase HQ".
