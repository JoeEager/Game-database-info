The player takes on the role of action movie hero, Indiana Jones, in a game that takes place over 3 different zones; the mines, a minecart chase and the temple. The first level features a number of platforms, ladders and slides and Indy must free kidnapped children by finding their cages and whipping them open.
The player must also keep an eye out for rattlesnakes and Thuggee guards. The second zone is a recreation of the infamous minecart chase in the movie and the player must guide Indy's cart to the bottom of the mine; keeping ahead of enemy carts and voiding traps and track-side enemies. The final area takes place in the temple itself and Indy must make his way to the altar and retrieve the Sankara stone. Indy must avoid guards and also flaming hearts thrown by the game's enemy boss, Mola Ram.
The player can choose to start the game on any one of 3 difficulty levels : easy, medium and hard. These are selected at the beginning of the game by entering the corresponding door. Once all 3 Sankara stones have been collected, Indy must work his way through a final mine and minecart section, before making his escape on the rope bridge and facing Mola Ram once and for all. Playing the easy level will not include this level the first time Indy acquires all three stones. Instead, a message will appear stating that Indy escaped on the rope bridge. The player is then returned to the game, starting again on a more difficult mines level.
