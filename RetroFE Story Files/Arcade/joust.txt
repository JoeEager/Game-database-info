AT SOME FAR-DISTANT TIME 2 fantastic gladiators meet and square off for battle. Each is mounted on a fanciful bird of prey (ostrich or stork) whose wings can carry it from the cliftops to the mouth of the abyss and hopefully back... or the bubbling lava below will increase it's toll.
While your mount is a skilled flyer your opponent is a shrewd gladiator. You must prove you are his better. Stealthily you must pilot your mount above him, and cleverly you must stalk him... to strike at the moment he least suspects you! And always remember this rule : In every Joust, the highest lance wins!
Of course your opponent will resist your attempts, all the while pursuing his own designs on you. Each gladiator has five (operator-adjustable) mounts. Every time you?re toppled you must mount a new bird for the next joust. The gladiator who scores the most dismountings is the winner.
YOUR PATH MAY SEEM CLEAR and your work cut out, but just them a flock of vicious Buzzard-Riders will ambush you! Ruthless even as they are dismounted, these wily Buzzard-Riders instantly lay their eggs. You must pick up the eggs or they will soon hatch into even more persistent and antagonistic foes!
Fortunately at 20,000 (operator-adjustable) points (should you make the grade) you will be awarded another bird to mount against the loyal opposition. Joust is designed for either one or two players.
The Joystick sends the gladiator and his ever stalwart mount (ostrich or stork) boldly to the left or to the right. The Flap Button causes the hero?s mount to spread its robust wings.,
