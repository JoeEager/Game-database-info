In his never ending quest for adventure and excitement, man invented off-road racing. These races were then brought before the masses by converting huge sports stadiums into dirt and mud obstacle courses in which off-road 'Ironmen' battled for top honors.
Now THE LELAND CORPORATION brings this fast moving, hard driving sport to the video game arena.
Ivan IRONMAN Stewart's SUPER OFF-ROAD is stadium off-road racing at it's best. One to three players are asked to test their dirt track skills against the best dirt truck driver in the world.
Contestants compete on 8 different tracks with a total of 16 configurations and these courses are packed with enough jumps, bumps, hills, and holes to challenge even the most skillful driver.
Winning drivers earn 'cash' prizes, and use this 'cash' to 'buff out' their machines. At the end of each race, players take their trucks to the 'Speed Shop' to buy better shocks, tires, engines, and higher top speed. They can also buy nitro packs to help them blast over the jumps and through the mud.
The 'Convert-a-Credit' feature allows drivers to add to their winnings by using credits as 'cash'. Each additional quarter, when converted, becomes $200,000.00 in game 'cash' and this additional 'cash' may be used for purchases in the 'Speed Shop'.
