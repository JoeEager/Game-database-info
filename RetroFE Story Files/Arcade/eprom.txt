The evil Reptilons are holding humans hostage on Planet X; one or two players must warp onto the planet and rescue them, destroying the swathes of enemy robot monsters that bar their way. players are armed with laser guns and a fiite number of bombs. Hostages are rescues by simply touching them, but players must be careful not to accidently shoot the hostages. Food can be found in storage lockers and will increase the players' energy levels. Some robots leave gems behind when they are destroyed, and these can be picked-up to give the players a weapon boost.
Robot Monsters is a colourful, comic book-esque and humorous pastiche of the classic sci-fi B-movie genre. The game has a similar feel to Atari's own arcade legend, "Gauntlet", although the scrolling levels of Robot Monsteres are viewed from a 3-D isometric viewpoint.
