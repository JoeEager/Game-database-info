Space Harrier is a sprite-scaling, into-the-screen shoot-em-up set in the "Fantasy Zone"; a surreal, abstract world composed of bright colours and a checkerboard-styled ground. The game's enemies are as unique as its setting; featuring prehistoric animals, alien pods, giant mushrooms and, at the end of every stage, a huge, fireball-spitting Chinese dragon.
The player's on-screen counterpart carries a portable jetpack under his arm, which allows him to fly as well as run along the ground. The jetpack is equipped with a laser, allowing the player to destroy both the game's many enemies as well as a variety of obstructions, such as trees and the floating rocks on level 1.
