I guess that explains why so many of today's games are drab, brown affairs - Konami used up all the coloured pixels in the nineties. There's more neon here than a Bangkok red-light district, but I'm sure Escape Kids will be an altogether more wholesome prospect than the fleshpots of south-east Asia: after all, it's about the healthy fun of strenuous, gladiatorial exercise. Before I get to the actual gameplay I always like to introduce the main characters, and the stars of Escape Kids are as colourful as they come.
