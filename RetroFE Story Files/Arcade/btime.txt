Burger Time is a 1- or a 2-player game that puts you in control of chef Peter Pepper. Direct him through the maze of ladders and platforms to build his burgers. Your job is to give him guidance while building his burgers and to keep him away from his pursuing enemies - Mr. Hot Dog Mr. Egg, and Mr. Pickle.
The enemies are very sneaky and, if given half a chance, will try to corner Peter at the end of one of the platforms or to trap him on one of the ladders he has to use to get from one level of platforms to another.
The enemies have no defense mechanisms of any kind. But they cannot be permanently eliminated either. As soon as Peter puts one enemy out of commission, another appears somewhere on the screen at the edge of one of the platforms.
However, in an emergency, Peter can slow the enemies down for short periods of time. This is accomplished by having him throw pepper on them. When hit by the pepper, the enemies will be disabled for several seconds. When they are disabled like this, Peter can walk right over them and not be caught.
As your skill level increases, the number and direction of enemies coming at Peter at any one time and the speed with which they move, is gradually increased; plus, their pursuit patterns become more and more devious while their overall accuracy is highly improved.
Bonus lives are awarded periodically throughout the game as you reach or pass certain preselected point values. Each task or event that Peter can perform or cause to happen has an assigned point value.
The object of the game is to survive as long as possible while constantly improving your skills and building as many Burgers as you can. As you do this, each following rack of the game will have more enemies, more difficult mazes, and will in general be harder to complete.,
