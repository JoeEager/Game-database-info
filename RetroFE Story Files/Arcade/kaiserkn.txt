Unusually for a game of this type, Kaiser Knuckle features blood; something that had hitherto only been associated with Midway's "Mortal Kombat" series. The blood option can be switched off in the game's dip settings.
Kaiser Knuckle was Taito's answer to the Capcom and SNK fighting games that were dominating the arcade scene in the early 90's, and while playable enough in its own right, and featuring, as it does, colourful graphics and highly animated backdrops, Taito's offering couldn't compete with the "Street Fighters" of the world, either on commercial or gameplay terms.
