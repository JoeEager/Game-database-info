The player could collect up to six orbs and could effectively 'buy' an upgrade from the six displayed at the bottom of the play area (speed-up, bombs, double, laser, multiple - which are orbs that follow the player's movements and add greater firepower - and a mystery 6th upgrade that is marked with an '?').
