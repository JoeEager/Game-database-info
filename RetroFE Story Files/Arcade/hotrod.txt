Between 1 and 4 players race each other over a variety of different surfaces on a selection of narrow, twisting roads, in this superb top-down racing game from Sega. Points and extra gasoline are placed at regular intervals on each track and any car that runs out of gas is automatically out of the race. Any player that finishes in the Top 3 is awarded bonus points - the amount dependant on whether they have finished 1st, 2nd or 3rd. These points can be used to buy a variety of car upgrades in the garage shop that appears at the end of every race. The upgrades available are; engine, tyre, wing and bumber.
