1 or 2 players control safari suit-wearing characters armed with harpoon guns and must destroy bouncing balls. When hit h balls break down into smaller fragments, in a similar fashion to Atari's 1979 classic, "Asteroids". The players can only fire virtually upwards, but can move right and left, as well as climbing the ladders that appear on many of the levels. Each screen features a backdrop of a famous world landmark. All bubbles must be destroyed before players can advance to the next screen.,
