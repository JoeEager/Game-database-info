Double Dragon for the Neo-Geo is the only Double Dragon game Technos Japan made since Super Double Dragon.  This was also Technos' first game for the Neo-Geo.  Instead of a side-scrolling fighting game like the original, this one is a one-on-one fighting game that's loosely based on 1994's Double Dragon film.  However, it does borrow elements and characters from the first four Double Dragon games (I, II, III and Super).
