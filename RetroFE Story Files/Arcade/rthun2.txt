A straight sequel to the suberb 1986 original Rolling Thunder 2 sees one or two players taking control of secret agents in this scrolling, platform shoot-em-up. The agents once again find themselves up against the sinister GERDRA organisation and its many armed agents. Gameplay is very similar to the original, with doors both releasing enemies and hiding weapons and ammunition for the players to collect.
Rolling Thunder 2 improves on its illustrious predessessor in a number of ways; the most obvious one being the vastly improved and incredibly colourful graphics. The most striking improvement, however, is the addition of a simultanious, co-operative two player mode; which adds immesurably to the game's appeal. For the sequel, the one player agent is a woman, with a second player taking the role of a male agent.,
