An interesting & highly cute hybrid between a Vs style puzzle game & an overhead shooter, players may choose to play the Story Mode in order to see the misadventures of Load Ran & her faithful yet somewhat annoying Rabbicat as they try to find the Magical Twinkle Star & save their world from the evil Mevious & his henchmen, or play the Free Character Mode in which you are able to pick any character (see codes below to select hidden characters!) to play the game and see their very own comical ending. A second player may challenge you at anytime so you better put those skills to the test & have lots of fun!
