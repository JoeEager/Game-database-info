It has been 50 years since the nuclear disaster. The sport of sprint racing is now a ruthless battle between armed cars. These races take place on tracks built in the ruins of the dangerous nuclear zone known only as the BADLANDS. It's all-out war on the track as players blast away at the drones (and each other) to finish first. Players shoot play-field targets for extra points and bonus missiles.
Bonus wrenches appear at regular intervals which can be collected and used to upgrade the player's vehicle. The available upgrades are : missiles tires, turbo, increased speed, and shields. This was to be Atari's last game in the 'Sprint' series.,
