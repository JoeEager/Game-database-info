An incredibly difficult but classic beat-em-up from Technos that sees a single player taking on huge gangs of street fighters. The game is spread across four stages levels, each of which is only 2 or 3 screens wide; giving the player nowhere to hide. Renegade was a rather more brutal game than others of its genre, and even allowed the player to keep attacking a downed enemy. It was also possible to pick up fallen enemies and throw them at oncoming fighters.
Renegade's designer would take what they learned while designing and writing Renegade and improve upon it in every conceivable way for the legendary "Double Dragon", released a year later.
