The third game in Konami's renowned "Gradius" series; the prequel being "Gradius" (known as "Nemesis" in Europe) and a spinoff called "Salamander" (also known as "Life Force"). Vulcan Venture strictly adheres to the shoot-em-up template set out by its hugely successful predecessor the game eschews the sideways/vertical scrolling alternate levels of "Salamander" and opts instead for "Gradius" sideways scrolling-only mechanic. Vulcan Venture is rightly considered to be one of the most demanding and difficult shoot-em-ups ever released.,
