A slight update of the superb "Punch-Out!!" boxing game that features five brand new larger-than-life opponents. The player once again assumes the role of a green-haired boxer who must fight his way up through five larger-than-life boxers to earn the title of 'Champ'.
The player's in-fight boxer is again viewed from behind and rendered with wire-frame graphics (so the player's opponent can be seen). Punches dodges and blocks must all be well-timed in order to defeat the opposing boxer. Thanks to the refined roster of new and hugely distinctive enemy fighters, "Super Punch-Out!!" is considered to be an improvement over the first game.,
