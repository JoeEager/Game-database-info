A 1-on-1 fighting game featuring a cast of 7 different fighters. Mortal Kombat took ideas from Capcom's seminal "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior" such as the game's special moves and projectiles. It also introduced a cast of photo-realistic digitized fighters for players to fight either as or against.
Battles are fought over the best of 3 rounds. At the end of a round a voice instructs the winner to 'finish him' and players have only a couple of seconds to try and execute their character's 'fatality', which sees the winner killing the loser in a spectacular and grisly fashion.,
