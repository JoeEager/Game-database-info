Taking the roll of one of the 2 brothers, Robo and Mobo (or both, in 2-player mode), players must make their way through a variety of scrolling platform levels and steal any loot they find, before making their way to the roof and escape in a waiting airship. Bonanza Bros. introduced a true sense of 3-D depth to the 2-D platform gameplay in that the enemy guards had a 'field-of-vision'; this made it possible for players to hide from the guards by ducking into alcoves, stairwells etc. Failure would see the brothers end up in jail.
The places the brothers burgle include a bank, a millionaire's mansion, a casino, a mint, an art gallery and a treasury.
