A single player takes on the role of a James Bond-esque secret agent codenamed 'Albatross'; who is a member of the "Rolling Thunder" agency. His mission is to stop a criminal organization known as Geldra as well as rescuing a captured agent, Lelia Blitz, and overthrowing Geldra's leader, Maboo.
Rolling Thunder is a horizontally-scrolling platform shoot-em-up that is very similar in style - and was an obvious influence on - Sega's legendary "Shinobi", released a year later. Like Shinobi, the action takes place on two levels of platforms; with the player jumping and dropping as and when required. Each level is littered with doors; most of these contain constantly emerging enemies and must be carefully passed; some doors, however, also provide ammunition and new weapons; such rooms are clearly marked.,
