Fighter's History is the first attempt of Data East to enter in competition with Capcom and his onnipresent Street Fighter II. Cause the many similarities shared by the game with the Capcom masterpiece (like the character select screen, the vs and winner/loser screens, the controls and the design and moves of some characters), Fighter's History was at least simply stamped by most of players like another SFII clone, and in this way remained ignored and obscured to the mass audience.
Although time after, the many beat'em up fans learning to appreciate this maybe too understimated fighting game, especially for his combo system quite simply to execute even for those players not so able with timing and button pressing, and for his fast gameplay : at this purpose most of the contribution was maked by his updated version relesed in 1994, Fighter's Hystory Dynamite (know as Karnov's Revenge in USA and Europe) that maked the gameplay more polish. Despite this at least Fighter's History never reaching that greatest success that maybe Data East still tried to chase.
Players choose one of 9 international fighters and battle to be the best in the world. Every character has his ending sequence and his own stage. There are also two not-selectable boss to challenge for reach the end, and the last one of them is real surprising!
