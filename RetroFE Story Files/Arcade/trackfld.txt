1 to 4 players compete against each other in 6 track and field events in this legendary, genre creating and much-copied game from Konami. Track and Field consisted of 2 run buttons per player (one for each 'leg' of the athlete) and one action button. Only 2 players could compete simultaneously so on 3 and 4-player games, players had to wait their turn. An extra life is awarded for every 100,000 points acquired. Each player must qualify in the current event before they can move on to the next. Hit the 2 run buttons to build up speed and use action button to jump or throw. The events are :
* 100M DASH - Run as fast as possible.
* LONG JUMP - Run to the take-off board then choose angle of jump (42 is optimal).
* JAVELIN - Run to the line then choose angle of throw (42 is optimal).
* 110M HURDLES - Run and time jumps over the hurdles.
* HAMMER THROW - As the athlete spins faster and faster, time release of hammer and angle of throw (45 is optimal).
* HIGH JUMP - The athlete will run to the bar, just as he reaches it, use Action button to start the jump and hold down the action button to reduce the angle of climb, i.e. you start going straight up at 90 degrees if you tap the button just once. Use run buttons while in the air to gain extra height.
