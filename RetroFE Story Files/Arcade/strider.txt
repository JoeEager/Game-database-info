A superb side-scrolling platform/beat-em-up in which the player takes control of 'Strider Hiryu', a ninja-style warrior who must defeat a legendary being known as Grandmaster Meio. Set in 2048, Meio has observed Earth from his dwelling in a far off galaxy, and has created a space station (known as 'The Third Moon') between Earth and its original moon, in order to rule Earth and continue his observation. Armed with a curved sword known as a 'Falchion', Strider must travel the globe (to locations such as the Soviet Union and the Amazonian Rain forest) to find and destroy Meio.
As well as his sword, Strider will encounter many power-ups, including robotic animals called 'Options' (a hawk and a leopard) which help him defeat enemies. He also has the ability to latch onto walls and ceilings using a metallic hook; a concept which really set the game apart from other platformers and allowed for some hugely inventive level design.,
