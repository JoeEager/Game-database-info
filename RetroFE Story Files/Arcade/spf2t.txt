A superb puzzle game for 1 or 2 players, based upon Capcom's legendary "Street Fighter" series. Puzzle Fighter's gameplay is reminiscent of Sega's superb 1992 puzzle game, "Puyo Puyo".
Players take on the role of one of the famous Street Fighter characters, which are represented visually between the 2 play areas in the middle of the screen. Players must then manipulate falling coloured gem blocks, matching the colours to gems already in the play area; before finally destroying them with orbs of a like colour. Whenever a player destroys a number of blocks, their on-screen Street Fighter counter-part will be shown attacking the player's opponent character. The fighting move used is dependent on both the colour and number of blocks the player has destroyed.
