Wade, Boris & Kyle's best friend, the lovely Sheena, is kidnapped in front of their eyes! So they venture into the hippie filled streets to maul anyone that gets in their way of rescuing her. Features awesome color-filled graphics, a kickin' vocal soundtrack and cool sound effects, lots of vicious moves (especially those from Boris!), a great sense of humor & plenty of great looking enemies & bosses. Break out fighting, everybody come on! :)
