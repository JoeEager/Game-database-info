A solid and hugely playable sequel to 1989's superb sideways scrolling shoot-em-up "U.N. Squadron". As with the original, players chose any one of 3 different jet fighters and battle their way through ten enemy-packed stages. Another idea carried over from "U.N. Squadron" is the end-of-level shop, which allows players to buy weapon and shield upgrades for their jet fighter.,
