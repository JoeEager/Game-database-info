The final, and most gruesome game in the Battletoads series. Unlike the home console games, the arcade version featues more intense violence and a touch of adult humor (including a very unique way to hurt enemies twice your size...). Each toad features their own unique set of smash hits which can be executed to finish off the enemies - such as the Drilla Killa, the Battletoad 'Butt and the Big Bad Boot.
