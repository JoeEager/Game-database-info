Between one and four players can choose to play either Leonardo (blue katana blades); Raphael (red, sais); Michaelangelo (orange, nunchakas); or Donatello (purple, bo staff) as the infamous turtles fight against the might of Shredder's army to rescue April O'Neil and Splinter; before a final confrontation with their arch-enemies Krang and The Shredder. Turtles was a superb use of its license and perfectly captured the spirit of both the comic-book and cartoon series upon which it was based. New players could join the game at any time.,
