An incredibly cute one or two player platform game in which two fairies must use their 'Rods of Sheesanomo' - two magical rods that enable the fairies to catch enemies and slam them into the platforms to kill them - to clear each level and continue their journey to the castle, to rescue their kidnapped mother.
As well as the magical rods, the fairies can also create a magical ladder - in a fashion very similar to that used in Taito's "Rainbow islands" - which can be utilised anywhere on a level that players wish, allowing them to reach other platforms or escape from any pursuing enemies.
