A sideways scrolling beat-em-up for 1 or 2 players in a medieval setting, in which players take on a variety of orcs, ogres, demons and other mythical creatures in their bid to destroy Satan.
The players' characters each carry a tiny warrior on their shoulders, the main characters possess the ability to 'morph' into a tiger, with the small, Mace-wielding warrior they were carrying now riding on the tiger's back.
