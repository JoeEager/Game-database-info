A classic and much-copied platform game in which the player takes on the role of the eponymous bell-ringer, Quasimodo, in his quest to rescue the beautiful Esmerelda from the tower of the castle fortress. Quasi must complete a number of static screens, each presenting the player with different obstacles, to reach Esmerelda. These range from spear-toting guards, to firey chasms to missiles (fireballs or arrows) that must be jumped. Some of the trickier screens can contain more than one of these obstacles, such as spear-toting guards AND missles.
One final problem that appears on every screen is the time limit. This takes the form of an enemy guard climbing the castle walls, if the soldier reaches the top, he will try to burn the Hunchback with his torch. If the Hunchback rings the bell before the guard has scaled the wall, a bonus score is rewarded.
