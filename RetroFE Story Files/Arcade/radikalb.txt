A game set in a Mediterranean environment in which, for the first time, players have the chance to show off their motor-cycle skills in a typically Italian urban setting. The theme of the game is an urban competition between 2 pizza delivery boys in a race to see who can deliver their pizza first. The urban circuit allows interaction with all kinds of elements: cars, vans, windows, fences, people, etc. To help you complete your mission, you can collect icons giving you more speed, power or time.
You must choose your pizza delivery boy - each with his own particular abilities -and level of difficulty. There are three levels: Margherita (easy), Capricciosa (medium) y Diavolo (difficult), from which you should choose according to your own skill level. There are four different races at each level to allow you to show the other delivery boy who has the most skill, daring and ability.
